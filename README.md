# LUPUMA: Low Complexity Unitary Principal-Singular-Vector Utilization for Model Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of LUPUMA, a novel algorithm for single-tone frequency estimation of one-dimensional complex signals in complex white Gaussian noise. LUPUMA stands out for its low space and time complexity, making it highly efficient for applications with limited resources and requiring rapid processing.

## Abstract
LUPUMA, based on subspace methods and unitary transformation, offers a uniform estimation variance across the entire frequency spectrum. It excels in short observations by achieving the lowest time complexity among its counterparts and asymptotically reaching the Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound. The algorithm's robustness is evident in its performance, matching that of maximum likelihood estimators under specific signal-to-noise ratio conditions.

## Algorithm Overview
LUPUMA operates by employing subspace techniques combined with unitary transformations. Key highlights include:
- Uniform variance estimation over the full frequency range.
- Optimal performance in scenarios with short observation lengths.
- Ideal for situations with limited sample numbers, computational power, or memory.
- Fast processing suitable for low-latency applications.
